The code attached is a Jupyter Notebook and it requires the dataset (THE LINK OF WHICH IS MENTIONED BELOW) to be uploaded on the Google drive.
Once the code has been executed the test image given to the model will predict the class of the object.

This model will be further fed into the Android Application (which we are currently working on). The simulation of the application is shown in the video.
